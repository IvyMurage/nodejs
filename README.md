# Simple Blog Application - Node.js Practice Project

This project was created to explore core Node.js features and familiarize myself with the Express framework and its MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The primary goal was to deepen my understanding of how to structure a Node.js application and work with key built-in modules.

### Key Concepts Explored:
- **File System (fs)**: Handling file operations such as reading, writing, and manipulating data.
- **HTTP Module**: Understanding how Node.js interacts with web servers at a low level.
- **Path Module**: Managing and resolving file paths effectively across different environments.
- **Express Framework**: Learning how to use Express to handle routes, middleware, and requests/responses.

### Project Overview:
This is a simple blog application where users can perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Itâ€™s designed as a learning project to practice building RESTful APIs, managing data storage, and structuring applications in the MVC pattern.

### Features:
- **Create**: Add new blog posts
- **Read**: View existing blog posts
- **Update**: Modify blog posts
- **Delete**: Remove blog posts

### What I Learned:
1. Setting up a Node.js project with Express.
2. Implementing basic routing and middleware in Express.
3. Working with file systems for data storage in a simplified manner.
4. Using MVC architecture to keep code organized and modular.
5. Handling HTTP requests and responses efficiently with Express.
